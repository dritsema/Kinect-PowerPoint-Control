### Kinect for Windows Hardware and Software Requirements  

The Kinect for Windows SDK, as its name suggests, only runs in a Windows environment.  

Specifically, it runs on x86 and x64 versions of Windows 7.  Compatibility with Windows 8 has not been tested as of this writing.  Because Kinect was designed for Xbox hardware, it requires roughly similar hardware on a PC to run effectively.  

Hardware Requirements
*	Dual-core, 2.66-GHz or faster processor
*	Dedicated USB 2.0 bus
*	2 GB RAM (4 GB recommended)
*	Kinect for Windows sensor, which includes special USB/power cabling  

Software Requirements
*	Microsoft .NET Framework 4
*	Kinect for Windows SDK
